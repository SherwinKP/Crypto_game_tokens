    "- Bitcoin's security relies on miners. As time goes on, Bitcoin will be forced to move transactions \"off block-chain\". \n",
    "- If Bitcoin moves off block-chain, miners cannot be compensated for these transactions.\n",
    "- If miners cannot be compensated, they won't mine. \n",
    "- If miners don't mine, network security goes down as time goes on. As time goes on, Bitcoin may become increasingly less secure and more risky to use as a safe haven or a way to save and store very large sums of money.\n",
    "- PeerCoin uses proof-of-stake for minting and tx processing, where stake is to the use of currency itself (ownership) to achieve certain goals. \n",

    "1. The validators stake a portion of their Ethers as stake.\n",
    "2. After that, they will start validating the blocks. Meaning, when they discover a block which they think can be added to the chain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it.\n",
    "3. If the block gets appended, then the validators will get a reward proportionate to their bets.\n",
    "4. However, if a validator acts in a malicious manner and tries to do a “nothing at stake”, they will immediately be reprimanded, and all of their stake is going to get slashed.\n",
